# Changelog

## 0.4.3
- Fix: clicking the panel button blanked Claude's chat and did not open the palette. The button was a `<button>` that synthesized an anchor click; a synthesized click arrives with `event.view === null`, so VSCode's webview link handler ignores it and the sandboxed frame self-navigates to the `vscode:` URI (blanking the chat) instead of routing to the extension. The button is now a real `<a>` the user clicks directly, so VSCode intercepts the click and opens the palette via `openExternal` without navigating the frame.

## 0.4.2
- Self-update from GitHub Releases: on startup (at most once a day) the extension checks for a newer release and offers a one-click "Update now" that downloads and installs the latest VSIX, then prompts to reload. VSIX installs don't auto-update on their own, so this is the install-once-stay-current path.
- The status-bar item now badges when an update is available ("Skills v0.4.1 → v0.4.2" on a warning background); clicking the item opens a small menu to open the palette or check for updates.
- New "Skills Palette: Check for Updates" command and a `claudeCodeSkillsPalette.autoUpdateCheck` setting to turn the startup check off.

## 0.4.1
- The status-bar item now shows the running extension version next to its label (e.g. "Skills v0.4.1"), read from the manifest so it tracks every release.

## 0.4.0
- Skill cards now use a consistent three-row block in both Grid and List views: name + tags, a one-line description, then all controls on one row.
- New open-folder icon on each card opens that skill's folder in the OS file manager, so you can edit its files or rename it.
- Preview is now a compact icon button (with tooltip) next to the open-folder icon, keeping the controls row narrow.
- List view cards are full-width blocks instead of a cramped single horizontal row, so long names, descriptions and buttons no longer collide or overflow the card.
- Long skill names truncate to one line, with the full name shown on hover.

## 0.3.1
- Internal: the palette webview client now ships as a static file (webview/palette-client.js) loaded via a nonce'd script reference, instead of being generated inline from function source at runtime.
- Initial state is passed as a non-executable JSON data block rather than embedded in inline code.
- No behaviour change - this removes dynamically-assembled script patterns so the extension can also be distributed through an extension marketplace.

## 0.3.0
- Configurable Skills Hub folder: set it from inside the palette via a new gear (settings) button in the header - Browse to a folder or paste a path. No more editing settings.json by hand.
- New `claudeCodeSkillsPalette.hubPath` setting (supports a leading `~` and `${env:VAR}`); leave it empty to use the default `~/.claude/SkillsHub`.
- Neutral default hub derived from your home folder, so the extension works for any user out of the box (no machine-specific path baked in).
- Actionable empty state: when no hub is set or it is empty, the palette shows a clear prompt with a 'Set hub folder...' button instead of a blank list.

## 0.2.0
- Two top-level view tabs in the palette: 'Hub' (the whole hub, as before) and 'This project' (only what is linked here).
- The project view splits its skills into a 'Local' section (linked to this project only) and a 'Global' section (linked globally, active in every project); a skill linked both ways shows only under Global.
- The 'This project' tab is disabled until a project folder is open, and falls back to 'Hub' if the project closes.
- Category counts and the 'All Skills' total are scoped to the active tab.

## 0.1.0
- Inject a "plug" button into the Claude Code panel (#orb-tools toolbar) that toggles a Skills Palette and stays lit while it is open.
- Webview palette: clickable category sidebar, text search, theme-coloured skill cards.
- In-panel README preview (rendered Markdown) for any skill, with a sticky Back bar.
- One-click link / unlink of a skill into the current project (or globally) via a Windows directory junction; project link is disabled for skills that are already global.
- Assign categories from a card; writes a central `skills-categories.json` manifest in the hub.
- QuickPick fallback command, status-bar entry, and a guaranteed deep-link path.
